# SnoverlayCustomizer
This is a really old tweak I made adding customization options to Snoverlay, that still works on iOS 13.2.2 and below.
I agreed not to release a separate Snoverlay tweak, but to instead implement the changes right into Snoverlay and make a pull request when finished... That was two years ago, and over time my interest faded in the project.  Since then though several users noticed it worked on iOS 13, and one asked to see the source code.  I modernized some of it, made it more efficient, and added lots of comments making it easier for new developers to understand what each step was for.

It still could use some work making it easy to understand,though, and improving the appearance of the settings bundle without breaking iOS 13 support, or any other older versions.

While working on adding these customizations and some bug fixes directly to my Snoverlay fork, I wanted to make this separate tweak available to users, along with a deb file they can download if desired.  Its also available in my repo for free, https://i0s-tweak3r-betas.yourepo.com The version in there will likely be more recent then the github version, as I'm really bad about updating GitHub after making improvements.  I will try to be better with this tweak.  Happy Holidays!
